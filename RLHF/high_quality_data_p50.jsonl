Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not use a training dataset with input-output pairs. Instead, the models find hidden patterns and insights from the given data on their own. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the underlying structure of the dataset, group the data according to similarities, and represent the dataset in a compressed format.
